# Smoked Meat

Meat can be preserved by drying and smoking it. Smoking meat takes a long time, but you can make a lot simultaneously.

	* Smoked meat lasts 2 seasons. It's categorized under MeatRaw, so that it can be used in all recipes that use meat, like meals and kibble.
	* The Smoked Meat recipe excludes itself as a possible ingredient, and disables human+insect meat from the ingredients used by default.
	* The smokepit is the campfire, modified to use less wood, and more slowly; create much less heat; die faster in the rain; smoke meat.
	* The smokehouse allows you to smoke much more meat simultaneously than the smokepit does. The original smokehouse author is Panggul_mas, https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=20387.0
	* The smokehouse looks funky when you rotate it. Sorry. I'm not artist enough to fix this. Panggul_mas's version sets it non-rotatable, but I think sometimes the lay of the land makes that inconvenient, and have sacrificed beauty for function.
	* I've made the delay agent on smokehouse-building the requirement for lots of construction materials instead of a Research prerequisite.
